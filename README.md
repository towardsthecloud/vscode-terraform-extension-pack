This is a collection of extensions that I've curated in this vscode extension pack to help you build, deploy and manage your Terraform modules.

<!-- TIP-LIST:START -->
> [!TIP]
> **Towards the Cloud runs the AWS foundation for modern product teams. This means your team ships faster, slashes AWS spend, and stay audit-ready without having to hire a platform squad.**
>
> Unsure where to start? Book a free AWS Account Review. We’ll analyse your AWS environment, hand you a security & cost report, and you decide whether to act on it yourself or have us execute. No pressure, no retainer required up front.

> <summary>☁️ <strong>See how we turn AWS chaos into a compliant, cost-efficient platform…</strong></summary>
> <br/>
>
> ### The problem: AWS complexity compounds fast
>
> Ad‑hoc builds become 40–60% overspend, unmonitored security gaps put customer data at risk, and engineers burn out running infrastructure instead of shipping products.
>
> ### Our managed foundation keeps you moving forward
>
> - ✅ **Compliant Landing Zone** – [Multi-account AWS CDK deployment](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-landing-zone) with 100% [CIS benchmark](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark.html) coverage,
> centralized logging, and SSO-ready access control.
> - ✅ **Production-ready CDK components** – Pre-hardened building blocks so teams launch new services without reinventing best practices.
> - ✅ **CI/CD with safe rollbacks** – GitOps workflows and governed pipelines that let you release faster with confidence.
> - ✅ **Quarterly cost & security reviews** – [Cost Optimisation](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-cost-optimization) plus [Security Reviews](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-security-review)
> delivered proactively.
> - ✅ **Fractional Cloud Engineer** – On-demand expertise from an architect who implemented enterprise-grade AWS infrastructure for over a decade.
>
> ### Outcomes our customers see
>
> - **30%+ lower AWS bill** – Continuous oversight prevents expensive drift ([30–60% documented savings](https://towardsthecloud.com/services/aws-cost-optimization#case-study)).
> - **SOC 2 / HIPAA acceleration** – Guardrails, logging, and evidence packs ready on day one.
> - **Audit-ready every quarter** – Automated monitoring plus recurring reviews keep findings under control.
> - **Faster product velocity** – Engineers build features, not managing infrastructure.
> - **Headcount leverage** – A [flexible retainer](https://towardsthecloud.com/pricing) replaces the cost of a full-time platform team.
>
> **Proof:** Y Combinator startup Accolade used our Landing Zone to [earn SOC 2 in record time](https://towardsthecloud.com/blog/aws-landing-zone-case-study-accolade):
